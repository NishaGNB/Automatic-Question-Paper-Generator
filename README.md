# Automatic QP Generator

This repository contains a backend (FastAPI) and a frontend (Vite/React) for an automatic question-paper generator.

Quick local Git setup and push instructions:

- Initialize repo and commit (already done by script):
  - `git init`
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
- Add a remote repo and push:
  - `git remote add origin <your-repo-URL>`
  - `git push -u origin main`

If you want me to add the remote and push, provide the remote URL (HTTPS or SSH) or a GitHub personal access token to create a new repo and I'll complete the push step for you.
